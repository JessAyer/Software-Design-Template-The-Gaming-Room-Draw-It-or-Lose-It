# The-Gaming-Room-Draw-It-or-Lose-It
Software Design Document

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

     The client, The Gaming Room had developed an android game called “Draw It or Lose It” and they have hired Creative technology
     Solutions to develop a web-based version of the game that is accessible on all operating systems. The Gaming Room has requested 
     help building an environment that allows for multiplayers and multiple teams to be able to compete on a turn-by-turn basis cross 
     platform.  

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

     I believe my strongest sections on the Software design Document are the Design constraints and Domain Model. Understanding what 
     the Client is asking for and what obstacles stand in your way before development begins and how to incorporate OOP principles can 
     streamline the planning and development processes. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

     The Domain Model and UML Diagram was helpful for designing code. It gave clear instructions as to how to build the program and 
     utilize design patterns. Building the code was straightforward once I knew exactly which attributes and methods were needed in 
     each class. Learning how to implement the design pattern was the most challenging part of the code but once I figured out the 
     pattern it was just a matter of re-applying it as needed.  

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

     The evaluation is what I have the least confidence in on my Software Design Template. Backend coding is new to me and I felt 
     like no matter how many hours I put into the evaluation, I kept wanting to change it. I don’t have and previous experience 
     with backend engineering so understanding what the client/server side confused me as well as learning the architecture of 
     two-tiered and multi-teared systems. I gained a better grasp after doing more research for the evaluation and would go back 
     and make a clear choice to work with a multi-tired architecture and adjust the evaluation accordingly. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

     The Software Design Document addresses the clients request for allowing multiplayer teams and multiple teams to play “Draw It or 
     Lose It” together while ensuring no duplicate player IDs, team names, or games exist. It also looks into the pro’s and con’s for 
     various OS and server options for hosting the game so that we can make sure that once it is lunched, it will work fluidly 
     cross-platform in the most cost effective way for the client.  

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

     When designing the software, I used the UML for my blueprint so I knew what elements to place where. Working with patterns is new 
     to me so I also utilized Edward Lavieri’s book “Hands-On Design Patterns with Java” to sculpt the code to meet the client’s 
     requirements. Keeping the e-book open beside my code on my computer screen helped me quickly troubleshoot my code. In the future 
     I will continue to use this book to become more familiar with other patterns.
